This collection of discord bots is something I made in my spare time just because I found this meme video to be quite humorous:

Have fun using it if you want.

To use this you need node.js installed and the ffmpeg binaries downloaded and added to the windows PATH (if doing this on windows).

This is kind of a pain to set up due to limitations on discord bots since it requires 11 bots total (1 bowler and 10 pins). If you want to set this up just go to the discord dev portal, make 11 applications with bots and copy the tokens into each auth.json and bot.js file (it's at the bottom of the bot.js file). You will also need to fix the path to the mp3 sound clip in the main bot.js file. I left a .bat file to quickly start up all 11 bots at once for ease of use as well.

Make sure to invite all the bots to whatever server you want to meme on. I made sure all the pin-bots have their status set to invisible so you don't see all 10 of them online.

Whatever, have fun with this, or don't.
I also left the images I used for the bowling and pin bots icons in here too.

The triggering command is 'bb!bowl', and if it breaks for whatever reason and doesn't leave chat use 'bb!stop'.
